# Development notes

Forge 1.18:

- Forge's class loader changes more-or-less require all dependencies to be modules, and some of my dependencies (particularly `kotlin-imgui`) only have non-module builds. While I have patched in my own classloader (which you can enable by setting the environment variable `O_PATCH_LOADER=true`) to have at least partial functionality in a development environment, some things will still have classloader conflicts. In my opinion, you're better off building it into a jar (which will shade all dependencies into the same module) and running it outside the IDE.

Fabric 1.17:

- To run the mod in a development environment, you currently need to set the environment variable `DEV_ENV=1`.
